Hello welcome to my SIOT project. Check out my webapp here: https://davidpriorhope.github.io/siot/

As a cyclist every day I arrive to university either cold or sweaty. I decided that enough is enough, I am almost 24 and I cannot keep arriving to university in such an unprofessional manner.

Thus I collected my body temperature data for a week during daily 22 minute cycles. Correlating this data to the number of layers I was wearing and the outdoor temperature allowed me to conduct supervised Machine Learning to produce a multivariate linear regression model.

Through the web app, it is now possible to see how many layers you should wear for a cycle commute in a city of your choice. Enjoy!

Please note, the machine learning model only has 7 data points
